# Frontend Mentor - Browser extensions manager UI

![Design preview for the Browser extensions manager UI coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

A fully functional, responsive UI built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, simulating a browser extension manager. This project was developed as part of the Frontend Monster Junior Challenge and includes dynamic interactivity powered by a local data.js file.

## ✨ Features
- 📋 Displays a list of browser extensions from a pre-defined dataset 
- 🌒 Dark mode toggle with smooth theme switching 
- ✅ Enable/Disable functionality for each extension
- ❌ Remove individual extensions from the UI
- 💡 Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- 🎨 Simple, clean interface modeled after real-world extension managers

## 🧪 How It Works
- data.js holds an array of browser extension objects.
- On page load, index.js dynamically renders each extension as a card using DOM manipulation.
- Users can:
  -Toggle enabled/disabled status for each extension
  - Remove an extension from the list
  - Switch between light and dark themes
- All functionality is handled on the frontend (no backend or database).
